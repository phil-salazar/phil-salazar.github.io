Hi, I'm Phil! I'm a technical professional who is passionate about analytics and machine learning, and about how to use them to transform the field of international development. I have worked in data analytics, business intelligence, and data engineering at financial technology startups in both the United States and Latin America, where I have worked across the technical stack, from ETL data pipelines and orchestration to developing reactive frontend experiences for web applications.

I'm currently focused on how alternative data sources and machine learning can enhance screening for individuals and businesses more inclusive access to credit in emerging markets, particularly in Latin America.

Separately, I am an enthusiastic proponent of wine education, and am working toward a WSET certification.

I hold degrees in Engineering from Stanford University and in International Development from Harvard University.
