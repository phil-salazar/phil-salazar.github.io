I'm a technical professional who is passionate about using analytics and machine learning to transform the field of international development. I am experienced in data analytics, business intelligence, and data engineering at financial technology startups in both the United States and Latin America. I am comfortable working across the technical stack, from ETL and data pipelines & orchestration to developing frontend experiences for web applications in React.

I'm currently focused on how alternative data sources and machine learning can enhance underwriting for individuals and businesses and provide more inclusive access to credit in emerging markets, particularly in Latin America.

I hold quantitative degrees in Engineering from Stanford University and International Development from Harvard University.
