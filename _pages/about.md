Hi, I'm Phil! I'm a technical professional who is passionate about modernizing the field of international development. I have worked at financial technology and government technology startups in both the United States and Latin America, where I have worked across the technical stack, from data pipelines and orchestration to developing reactive frontend experiences for web applications.

I'm currently focused on how alternative data sources and better screening algorithms can enhance access to credit for individuals and businesses in emerging markets, particularly in Latin America.

Separately, I am an enthusiastic proponent of wine education, and am working toward a WSET certification.

I hold degrees in engineering from Stanford University and recently completed my masters in international development from Harvard University.
