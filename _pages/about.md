Iâ€™m a young professional experienced in business intelligence, data science and data engineering at financial technology startups in both the United States and Latin America. 

As a technical professional, I enjoy working across the technical stack, including configuring cloud services, deploying data pipelines and machine learning models, and building frontend experiences in React. 

As a leader, I enjoy applying my graduate-level training in finance and economics to make sure technical products align with competitive strategy.

I hold degrees in engineering from Stanford and economics from Harvard.
